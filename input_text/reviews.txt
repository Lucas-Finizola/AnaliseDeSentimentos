Product: Bluetooth Headphones

While the sound is decent, the headphones are uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The connection also drops occasionally, which is frustrating.


Product: Coffee Maker

This coffee maker is super easy to use and makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. The programmable feature is a lifesaver in the mornings

Product: Fitness Tracker

The tracker is not very durable; the screen scratched within a week. It also overestimates calories burned, which is misleading.



Hotel Review


The hotel exceeded my expectations in terms of ambiance and comfort. The lobby is grand and welcoming, with a lovely aroma that sets the mood right away. The rooms are well-equipped with modern amenities, including a rain shower and a smart TV. The staff was incredibly friendly, going out of their way to accommodate special requests. The hotel's location is ideal for tourists, close to public transport and within walking distance of key attractions. I also appreciated the spa services, which were relaxing and professionally handled. The complimentary welcome drink was a nice touch that made us feel valued as guests.

Although the hotel looks luxurious on the surface, there were several disappointing aspects of our stay. The elevators were frequently out of service, leading to long waits or having to use the stairs. The room, while visually appealing, had maintenance issues like a leaky faucet and a faulty hairdryer. Room service was inconsistent, with items missing from orders and slow delivery times. Noise from the nearby construction site made it difficult to relax, and the curtains didnâ€™t fully block out the morning sun. Lastly, while the breakfast buffet was varied, many items were cold, and the dining area felt overcrowded. For a hotel of this caliber, I expected a smoother and more polished experience.
